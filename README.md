# Wisdom Interrogatory: An Interactive Clarification System for Legal Question Answering


## Project Overview
ðŸŒŸ Wisdom Interrogatory is an interactive clarification system for legal question answering. When a user submits a legal question to the system, it requires the user to select their geographic location. After receiving the initial query, the system determines if it lacks crucial information; if so, it generates clarifying questions and options for the user to choose from. Once the system has all the necessary information from the user, it produces an in-depth jurisprudential analysis encompassing three aspects: fundamental legal relationships, the nature of the actions involved, and judicial obligations.
